2023 Hesburgh Library Hackathon

Theme: Hacking for Harmony
Inspiration: Social Media for Good

Description:
A social app that connects hospitalized patients with their loved ones and fellow patients. The app allows hospital staff to share updates and photos with the patientâ€™s guardians, who may not be able to visit them frequently. The app also enables the patient to chat with their guardians and other patients in the same hospital, and to post photos and messages about their recovery journey. The app aims to reduce worry and loneliness for both the patient and their guardians, and to foster a sense of community and support among the hospital users.

Mission:
With over 30 million Americans having overnight stays on an annual basis, it can be distressing for family members of overnight patients. Our application, Med Mates puts those fears to rest by providing family and friends with real-time updates of overnight patients. We hope to create a more harmonious society by keeping families and friends together during times that matter the most.

Implementation:
Used Reactjs, javascript, HTML, CSS to create a website to connect healthcare professionals, patients, families, and friends together.
